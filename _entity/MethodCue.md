title: "Method Cue"
order: 9
---

This cue indicates the types of studies. Structural analyses, such as
crystallography and NMR, gives us more direct observation for enzyme
reactions, whereas computational studies only suggest possibilities,
for which Certainty levels of events are annotated as “Probable”..
