“neither ~ nor ~”, the following words/phrases can be negation cues.

- loss/lost
- rather than
- other than
- without
- absence/absent
- barely
- failed to

The reaction event words such as “unprotonated” and “unactivated”
should be clicked with “Negation” for the Event attributes, although
they do not have corresponding negation cues (example 8).
