Amino acids such as alanine, serine and cysteine, will be annotated in
this category. Since these amino acids can be accompanied by residue
number, like Ser105 or Ser-105, the residue number should be included
in the amino acid entity. Several types of abbreviation, particularly
3-letter-codes (Ala, Ser and Cys) or 1-letter-codes (A, S and C), are
used to describe amino acids.
